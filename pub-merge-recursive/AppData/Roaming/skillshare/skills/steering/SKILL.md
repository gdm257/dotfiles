# kiro-steering Skill

## Role
You are a specialized skill for maintaining `.rulesync/rules/` as persistent project memory.

## Options

- `--local` — Keep steering out of version control. Creates `.rulesync/rules/.gitignore` that ignores the entire steering directory. Use when steering should stay local to the developer's machine.

## Core Mission
**Role**: Maintain `.rulesync/rules/` as persistent project memory.

**Mission**:
- Bootstrap: Generate core steering from codebase (first-time)
- Sync: Keep steering and codebase aligned (maintenance)
- Preserve: User customizations are sacred, updates are additive

**Success Criteria**:
- Steering captures patterns and principles, not exhaustive lists
- Code drift detected and reported
- All `.rulesync/rules/*.md` treated equally (core + custom)

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

If steering context is already available from conversation, skip redundant file reads.

- For Bootstrap mode: Read `templates/{product,tech,structure}.md` from this skill's directory
- For Sync mode: Read all existing `.rulesync/rules/*.md` files
- Steering principles are embedded in the "Steering Principles" section below

## Scenario Detection

Check `.rulesync/rules/` status:

**Bootstrap Mode**: Empty OR missing core files (product.md, tech.md, structure.md)
**Sync Mode**: All core files exist

---

## Bootstrap Flow

1. Read `templates/product.md`, `templates/tech.md`, `templates/structure.md` from this skill's directory
2. Analyze codebase (JIT):

#### Parallel Research

The following research areas are independent and can be executed in parallel:
1. **Product analysis**: README, package.json, documentation files for purpose, value, core capabilities
2. **Tech analysis**: Config files, dependencies, frameworks for technology patterns and decisions
3. **Structure analysis**: Directory tree, naming conventions, import patterns for organization

After all parallel research completes, synthesize patterns for steering files.

3. Extract patterns (not lists):
   - Product: Purpose, value, core capabilities
   - Tech: Frameworks, decisions, conventions
   - Structure: Organization, naming, imports
4. Generate steering files (follow templates and steering principles below)
5. If `--local` flag is set, create `.rulesync/rules/.gitignore` with `*` to ignore the entire directory
6. Present summary for review

**Focus**: Patterns that guide decisions, not catalogs of files/dependencies.

---

## Sync Flow

1. Load all existing steering (`.rulesync/rules/*.md`)
2. Analyze codebase for changes (JIT)
3. Detect drift:
   - **Steering → Code**: Missing elements → Warning
   - **Code → Steering**: New patterns → Update candidate
   - **Custom files**: Check relevance
4. Propose updates (additive, preserve user content)
5. Report: Updates, warnings, recommendations

**Update Philosophy**: Add, don't replace. Preserve user sections.

---

## Steering Principles

Steering files are **project memory**, not exhaustive specifications.

### Golden Rule
> "If new code follows existing patterns, steering shouldn't need updating."

### What to Document
- Organizational patterns (feature-first, layered)
- Naming conventions (PascalCase rules)
- Import strategies (absolute vs relative)
- Architectural decisions (state management)
- Technology standards (key frameworks)

### What to Avoid
- Complete file listings
- Every component description
- All dependencies
- Implementation details
- Agent-specific tooling directories (e.g. `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.claude/`)
- Detailed documentation of metadata directories (settings, automation)

### Example Comparison

**Bad** (Specification-like):
```markdown
- /components/Button.tsx - Primary button with variants
- /components/Input.tsx - Text input with validation
- /components/Modal.tsx - Modal dialog
... (50+ files)
```

**Good** (Project Memory):
```markdown
## UI Components (`/components/ui/`)
Reusable, design-system aligned primitives
- Named by function (Button, Input, Modal)
- Export component + TypeScript interface
- No business logic
```

### Security

Never include:
- API keys, passwords, credentials
- Database URLs, internal IPs
- Secrets or sensitive data

### Quality Standards

- **Single domain**: One topic per file
- **Concrete examples**: Show patterns with code
- **Explain rationale**: Why decisions were made
- **Maintainable size**: 100-200 lines typical
- **Common mistakes**: Record known pitfalls and forbidden patterns

### Preservation (when updating)

- Preserve user sections and custom examples
- Additive by default (add, don't replace)
- Add `updated_at` timestamp
- Note why changes were made

### File-Specific Focus

- **product.md**: Purpose, value, business context (not exhaustive features)
- **tech.md**: Key frameworks, standards, conventions (not all dependencies)
- **structure.md**: Organization patterns, naming rules (not directory trees)
- **Custom files**: Specialized patterns (API, testing, security, etc.)

### Notes

- Custom files equally important as core files

## Tool Guidance

- `Glob`: Find source/config files
- `Read`: Read steering, docs, configs
- `Grep`: Search patterns
- `Bash` with `ls`: Analyze structure

**JIT Strategy**: Fetch when needed, not upfront.

## Output Description

Chat summary only (files updated directly).

### Bootstrap:
```
Steering Created

## Generated:
- product.md: [Brief description]
- tech.md: [Key stack]
- structure.md: [Organization]
- .gitignore: [If --local] Ignores entire steering directory

Review and approve as Source of Truth.
```

### Sync:
```
Steering Updated

## Changes:
- tech.md: React 18 → 19
- structure.md: Added API pattern

## Code Drift:
- Components not following import conventions

## Recommendations:
- Consider api-standards.md
```

## Examples

### Bootstrap
**Input**: Empty steering, React TypeScript project
**Output**: 3 files with patterns - "Feature-first", "TypeScript strict", "React 19"

### Sync
**Input**: Existing steering, new `/api` directory
**Output**: Updated structure.md, flagged non-compliant files, suggested api-standards.md

## Safety & Fallback

- **Security**: Never include keys, passwords, secrets (see principles)
- **Uncertainty**: Report both states, ask user
- **Preservation**: Add rather than replace when in doubt

## Notes

- All `.rulesync/rules/*.md` loaded as project memory
- Templates live in this skill's `templates/` directory
- Focus on patterns, not catalogs
- "Golden Rule": New code following patterns shouldn't require steering updates
